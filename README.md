# skyux-spa-addin-flyout-demo

This SPA demonstrates a SKY Add-in implementation using SKY UX, and includes a tile that can be shown on any page as well as an example
of showing flyouts (both within the same SPA as well as a separate web application).

This code is running live at https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/addin-flyout-demo.
